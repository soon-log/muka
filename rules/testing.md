# Testing Requirements

## Minimum Test Coverage: 80%

Test Types (ALL required):

1. **Unit Tests** - Individual functions, utilities, components
2. **Integration Tests** - API endpoints, database operations
3. **E2E Tests** - Critical user flows (Playwright)

## Test-Driven Development

MANDATORY workflow:

1. Write test first (RED)
2. Run test - it should FAIL
3. Write minimal implementation (GREEN)
4. Run test - it should PASS
5. Refactor (IMPROVE)
